--Vcore Mod--
This mod adds a one super rare ore (Talonite) that can be used to craft a set of tools and a chest. If the mod throwing is installed a Talonite bow will be come availble to craft, otherwise it ignores the bow. Also included is a admin sword that can break everything (some mods have different groups so may varry for different mods, example = bushes from VanessaE's plant life, the admin sword will not dig the bushes). For now this mod contains a 3d_ladder that adjusts the default ladder code. In future versions this will be removed and separated into a different mod.
